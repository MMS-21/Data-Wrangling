# Data Wrangling

Welcome to the "Data Wrangling" repository! This repository serves as a collection of projects and scripts focused on the art of data wrangling, also known as data munging. Data wrangling involves the process of cleaning, transforming, and enriching raw data to make it more suitable for analysis and modelling.

## About Data Wrangling

Data wrangling is an essential step in the data analysis workflow, as it ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and structured for further analysis. This repository showcases various data wrangling projects, ranging from cleaning messy datasets to performing complex transformations and feature engineering tasks.

## Repository Contents

- **Cleaning Projects**: Projects focused on cleaning and preprocessing messy or incomplete datasets from diverse sources.
- **Transformation Projects**: Projects demonstrating how raw data can be transformed into a more structured and usable format for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects**: Projects that conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover insights and trends within datasets.
- **Feature Engineering Projects**: Projects that showcase the creation of new features or variables from existing data to enhance model performance.
- **Web Scraping Projects**: Projects that involve the development of web scraping scripts to extract data from websites for analysis.
- **Integration Projects**: Projects demonstrating the integration of multiple datasets from different sources to enrich the analysis.
- **Visualization Projects**: Projects focused on visualizing cleaned and transformed data using charts, graphs, or maps to effectively communicate findings.
