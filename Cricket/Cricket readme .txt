This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to cleaning and analyzing a dataset containing cricket player statistics. The dataset includes information about players' careers, batting statistics, and other relevant attributes.

**Data Cleaning Steps:**

1. **Loading the Data:**
    - Load the dataset using pandas `read_csv()` or an appropriate method.

2. **Changing Column Names:**
    - Rename columns to be more descriptive and consistent.

3. **Checking for Null Values:**
    - Identify missing values (null values) in the dataset using `isnull()` or `info()`.

4. **Filling Null Values:**
    - Fill or impute missing values using methods like `fillna()`.

5. **Checking Duplicates:**
    - Identify duplicate rows using `duplicated()` and check for duplicate values in specific columns if needed.

6. **Dropping Duplicates:**
    - Remove duplicate rows using `drop_duplicates()` to ensure data uniqueness.

7. **Creating New Columns:**
    - Split existing columns to create new ones using methods like `str.split()`.

8. **Converting Column Types:**
    - Convert column data types using `astype()` or specific conversion functions.

9. **Additional Calculations:**
    - Calculate new metrics based on existing data, such as career length, average batting strike rate, etc.

**Data Analysis:**

- Generate descriptive statistics about the data.
- Visualize the data using various plots and charts.
- Draw insights and conclusions based on the analysis.

**Summary:**

This notebook demonstrates the process of cleaning and analyzing a cricket player statistics dataset.
